Assignment 3

Data file:

NC_013204.gb


Task:

The data file is a Genbank file of the E. lenta DSM 2243 genome (yay!). We will be using 
BioPython in this assignment (http://biopython.org/wiki/Biopython). As an exercise, try 
installing it on your own; if you have issues, I can help. (Note: if you have successfully 
installed it, the import line should not lead to an error if you run the script)

Use Biopython to parse this file for CDS features that have the word "reductase" in the 
product annotation. When found, write the following to a new file: (1) locus tag, 
(2) product, and (3) protein sequence. These should be separated by a tab; please refer 
to the expected output file.


Tips: 

I suggest the following general strategy:

- use SeqIO to read the file; specify "genbank" format, and use the handle "seq_record"
- iterate through each feature, using "seq_record.features"

    - exercise: - print the feature and take some time to explore this output; open the 
    			  Genbank file in simple text editor and notice how the various elements 
    			  in the printed output relate to the Genbank file
                - notice that each feature has a dictionary called "qualifiers", which
                  contains key-value pairs
                - notice that the values are in a list of length 1 (this is important
                  for when you need to access them later!); you can tell that this is
                  a list by the square brackets

- check if the feature "type" is CDS

    - note: there is a difference between the assignment operator (=) and the
            equality operator (==). I had to learn this the hard way when I first
            started scripting on my own. :p
    
- check if the "product" contains the word "reductase"
- write the requested feature information to a new file, in tabular format
  (note: the tab character is "\t")

    - locus tag
    - product
    - translation
