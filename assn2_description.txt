Task:
Instead of writing a Python script (i.e., Assignment 1), we will use the shell to achieve the same result.
That is: using bash commands, generate a list of all of the sequence identifiers in the fasta file. 
The output should be saved to a new file. 

Tips:
The following commands may be useful to know: 
grep
cut
> (redirect standard output)
| (pipe)
diff
