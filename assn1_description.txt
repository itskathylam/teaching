Data file: 
seqs.fa

Task:
Write a Python script that will output a list of all of the sequence identifiers in the fasta file. 
The output can simply be printed to the screen, or if you are feeling ambitious, can be saved in a new file. 
Note that the greater-than signs (“>”) are not a part of the sequence identifier!

Expected output:
v6hpcrq3xkymiazmk4q2gt28q983u6wceq978g4i3i7yrwo1fzekhl52vzwt 
romt3wezfr5ax2bhof2peex3y9o75n0m19uod01ekql61y1al0xjfw1w7fle 
wrtqujpskw4zsowfh14614ocqprl34imsfjn0k5z4hfsxan0xt233l3cly2o
... and so on

Tips:
There are many different ways of doing this. I would suggest the following general approach: 
1. open the file
2. iterate through the lines in the file
3. check the line for the presence of the “>”
4. when this character is found, do something. :)

Note:
If you need help installing Python and getting started, this is totally normal and I can help with this.
